# This is a Travel Management System project

## From Tribhuvan University (Saraswati Multiple Campus)

## BCA(Bachelor of Computer Applications)

## Solo university project done by Santosh(Rustam) Shrestha

_kept in GitHub for showcasing and in turn enhancing modifying and debugging code in the way_

Technologies used: C programming language

Database: Struct

Paradigm: functional

Purpose: Project completion

#### workflow:

1. when user inputs 1, new user can be added with the asked details
2. when user inputs 2, new user details excluding passowrd can be shown
3. when user inpts 3, details of user can be edited after inputting correct id and pasword
4. when user inputs 4, this will exit the application

### seven different functions are defined

_1. wait 7s function makes a delqy for 7 second delay depends on device_

_2. placefinder function takes id and assigns the adjacent place with ID_

_3. display operation that takes integer input and assigns the adjacent operation of entered ID_

_4. displayDest function displays all the destinations available to visit with adjacent ID_

_5. registeruser function registers user name id password and place to visit in the pseudo struct database_

_6. find function finds the details with given ID without revealing password_

_7. editDetails function was supposed to edit user details asking ID and passwword and if not matched it was supposed to display blocked message only but due to some reason I was unable to enable that feature due to some errors_

_main function does all the integrating and interfacing works_
